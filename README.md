# car_brand_classification
When we see a car our brain learns its features by learning different parameters such as model, logo, design, etc. Based on that knowledge whenever we look at a new car, we can take decision based on learning parameters that this car belongs to BMW or Toyota. Well, this is the basic function of a human brain
 Suppose if we want to predict the brand of a car, we see its model, logo and learn this car is from Audi or Maruti or BMW or whatever it is.This deepleaning project thats the input of the car and tells us which brand the car is.
